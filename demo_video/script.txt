[highlight: target box]

[voice] Click on any sentence to select. And work on it.

[voice] As you may have noticed, the IMT interface will respond to your input.
[voice] You will have access to three types of suggestions while working in this interface:
[voice] First, full sentence suggestions. Shown in grey as you have already seen.

The interface may suggest multi-word phrases, but the suggestions will always match your partially-entered word. If you wish to use a suggested term in your translation, you may click on it using the mouse.

Or, you may select the term using the up/down arrows and then hitting the ENTER key.

[voice] After you finish entering a word --- namely, each time after you hit the whitespace key --- the full sentence suggestion will be updated. Based on your partially-entered response, the interface will make its best effort to complete the sentence for you.
