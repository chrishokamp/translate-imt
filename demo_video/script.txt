[voice] Thank you for joining our experiment. We are testing a new interactive CAT tool. In this experiment you will translation several documents using both a standard post-editing interface and the new interactive interface. 

POST-EDITING

[voice] Let's start with post-editing. When the UI opens, you will see source sentences arranged as they would appear in a document or word processor. The current source sentence is highlighted with a blue border. Below each source sentence is a textbox populated with a suggested translation. You can edit, delete, or submit the suggested translation.

[voice] When you finish editing the segment. You can move to the next segment by pressing Control+Enter. This is the same key sequence as SDL Trados, if you're familiar with that tool. You can also move back up by pressing Shift+Enter. These two commands allow you to navigate through the document using only the keyboard.

[voice] You can also click on various segments to navigate the document. However, both the post-editing and interactive interfaces can be operated completely from the keyboard. With a little practice, we expect that you'll be able to translate more quickly if you don't rely on the mouse.

[voice] When you are satisfied with all of your translations, you can press Submit at the bottom of the page.

[voice] Now let's look at the interactive interface.


INTERACTIVE MACHINE TRANSLATION INTERFACE

[voice] In the next translation module, you will be using an interactive machine translation interface. The UI includes three types of interactive aids.

[voice] First, you can lookup source terms by hovering over them with the mouse. You can select terms by clicking.

[voice] Second, the target box shows the best machine suggestion in gray. *You cannot edit this suggestion.* However, you can select/accept parts of it in two ways. To select the text adjacent to the cursor, press Tab. To select a translation option farther down, just start typing the string and then press Tab.

[voice] Accepted text is always black.

[voice] Third, sometimes several translation options will appear in a drop-down box. To select the top choice, press Tab. You can also filter the list by typing and then selecting Tab. The arrow keys can also be used to navigate the drop-down. You can click the drop-down, but you may find that the keyboard is faster with a little practice.

[voice] If you move back to edit the black text, you can press Tab to quickly move back to the end of the partial translation in black.

[voice] The gray text is never submitted. If you are satisfied with you translation in black, don't worry if there is additional gray text at the end.

[voice] When you are done, submit your responses by clicking on the "Submit Translations" button at the bottom of the page.
