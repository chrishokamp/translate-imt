[voice] Thank you for joining our experiment. We are testing a new interactive CAT tool. In this experiment you will translation several documents using both a standard post-editing interface and the new interactive interface. 

POST-EDITING

[voice] Let's start with post-editing. When the UI opens, you will see source sentences arranged as they would appear in a document or word processor. The current source sentence is highlighted with a blue border. Below each source sentence is a textbox populated with a suggested translation. You can edit, delete, or submit this translation in full.

[voice] When you finish editing the segment. You can move to the next segment by pressing Control+Enter. This is the same key sequence as SDL Trados, if you're familiar with that tool. You can also move back up by pressing Shift+Enter. These two commands allow you to navigate through the document using only the keyboard.

[voice] The mouse does work. You can click on various segments to navigate the document. However, both the post-editing and interactive interfaces can be operated completely from the keyboard. With a little practice, we expect that you'll be able to translate more quickly if you don't rely on the mouse.

[voice] When you are satisfied with all of your translations, you can press Submit at the bottom of the page.

[voice] Now let's look at the interactive interface.


INTERACTIVE MACHINE TRANSLATION INTERFACE

[voice] In the next translation module, you will be using an interactive machine translation interface. The UI includes three types of interactive aids.
[fade in and fade out caption: "Interactive machine translation"]

[voice] Below each source sentence, you will see a suggested translation shown in grey. *You cannot edit this text*. It is there as a reference. You will also see a drop-down box with one or more suggested "completions." In this interface you will be alternating between typing your own translations and accepting and manipulating machine suggestions.
[highlight: target box]

[voice] You can select suggestions several ways. Tab or Return always chooses the top completion. When more than one suggestion appears, you can filter the box by typing...using the arrow keys...or clicking.

[voice] As you start typing, your translation will be shown in black replacing the suggested text.
[enter some text into the 1st target box]

[fade in and fade out caption: "Three types of suggestions"]

[voice] The IMT interface will respond to your input. You will notice that both the grey suggested translation and the drop-down will update based on the translation that you've typed so far.

[fade in caption: "Suggestions for the current word"]
[voice] The interface may suggest multi-word phrases, but the suggestions will always match your partially-entered word.

[voice] If you want to select large blocks of text, you can tab quickly. The suggestions will not update, so you'll have time to select the visible text.

[fade in caption: "Source lookup"]
[voice] You also have access to source lookup throughout your translation session. Mouse over any word in the source text to see a list of suggested translations.
[mouse movement]
To use a suggested term, click to enter the text in your typing area.
[mouse click]
The suggestions are ranked by confidence. The most probable term is at the *bottom* of the list and is colored with the most intense shade. Less likely translations are higher in the list, and are in lighter shades.

[fade in caption: "Typing area"]
[voice] Let's talk a bit more about the typing area.
[voice] You may interact with text that you've already entered --- namely, any text shown in black --- in the same way you interact with a regular text box. You may select, copy, paste, delete the text, and so on.
[select, move cursor, copy, paste, delete]
However, you can only interact with the suggested text --- in grey and blue --- through typing
[enter some text]
If you edit part of the prefix, you can quickly move back to the end of the prefix by pressing the Tab key. Suggested completions will then start to appear.

[fade in caption: "Reordering"]
[voice] The interface supports reordering from the keyboard. If you see part of a suggested translation in the grey text that is not adjacent to your prefix, just start typing that word. The interface will match substrings in the gray text and allow you to select them.

[fade in caption: "Navigation"]
You can navigate the interactive interface just as you did the post-edit interface.
[mouse movement, mouse click]
To move down, simply hit CTRL+ENTER.
[ctrl+enter]
To move backward to the previous sentence, you may hit SHIFT+ENTER.
[shift+enter]
You may show and hide the current word suggestions by hitting the ESCAPE key.
[escape, escape]
If you prefer, you may also turn off all suggestions by unchecking the appropriate checkbox at the top of the screen. To turn suggestions back on, check the corresponding box again.

[fade in caption: "Idle Timer"]
We ask that you complete this translation session in a single continuous session.
You will see an idle time at the bottom left corner of the webpage.
If you pause for more than 3 minutes, your response will be automatically submitted.
Any additional text entry will reset the timer.
[enter some text]

When you are done, submit your responses by clicking on the "Submit Translations" button at the bottom of the page.
