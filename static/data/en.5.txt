The investment legend, Warren Buffett, could only support such caution. In a CNBC interview, he said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis.
In his opinion, it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle out of the window to invest in the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the veteran company's share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading.
The shares closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett claims to have paid 170 dollars on average per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
