As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
