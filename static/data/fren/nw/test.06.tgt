How do you select them?
We have tried to compile a programme, which speaks for all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear.
Further details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future?
