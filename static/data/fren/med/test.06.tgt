For metastatic pancreatic cancer, the mediansurvival in the patients treated with Tarceva was 5.9 months, compared to 5.1 months in those taking placebo.
However, there was no survival advantage for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that had not spread beyond the pancreas.
What is the risk associated with Tarceva?
In clinical studies, the most common side effects when taking Tarceva (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were rash and diarrhoea.
Most of these were not serious and could be managed without treatment.
