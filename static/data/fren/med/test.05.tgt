In both studies, Tarceva was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) and the main measure of effectiveness was "median survival' (time until 50% of the patients were still alive).
What benefit has Tarceva shown during the studies?
For lung cancer, the median survival for the Tarceva patients was 6.7 months, compared with 4.7 months for the patients treated with placebo.
After 12 months, 31.2% of the patients taking erlotinib were still alive, compared with 21.5% of patients treated with placebo.
When looking at the results in patients who received Tarceva, and according to their tumour type, the survival figures were 8.6 months in patients who were "EGFR-positive" (those who had tumour cells that were shown to carry EGFR), compared with 5.0 months in patients who were EGFR-negative.
