This allows the blood pressure to drop, reducing the risks associated with high blood pressure, such as having a stroke.
Karvea was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 712 patients and with other medicines for hypertension (atenolol, enalapril or amlodipine) in 823 patients.
For the treatment of kidney disease, Karvea was studied in two large studies involving a total of 2,326 patients with type 2 diabetes.
One study looked at markers of kidney damage by measuring whether the kidneys were releasing the protein albumin into the urine.
The second study looked at whether Karvea increased the time taken until the patients" blood creatinine levels had doubled (a marker of kidney disease), until they needed a kidney transplant or dialysis, or until they died.
