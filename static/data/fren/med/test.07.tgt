More serious rash and diarrhoea occurred in approximately 5-10% of Tarceva-treated patients and each side effect caused up to 1% of patients to stop treatment.
Patients with persistent and severe diarrhoea should contact their doctor, as they may be at risk of low blood potassium levels and kidney failure.
They may need to be treated in hospital.
For the full list of side effects reported with Tarceva, please see the Package Leaflet.
Tarceva should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to erlotinib or any of the other ingredients.
