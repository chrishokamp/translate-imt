The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in diastolic blood pressure (the blood pressure measured between two heartbeats).
For the treatment of kidney disease, Aprovel was studied in two large studies involving a total of 2,326 patients with type 2 diabetes.
One study looked at markers of kidney damage by measuring whether the kidneys were releasing the protein albumin into the urine.
The second study looked at whether Aprovel increased the time taken until the patients" blood creatinine levels had doubled (a marker of kidney disease), until they needed a kidney transplant or dialysis, or until they died.
In the first kidney disease study, Aprovel was more effective than placebo at reducing the risk of developing kidney damage as measured by protein excretion.
