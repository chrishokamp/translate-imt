Karvea is also used to treat kidney disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes).
Karvea is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age, because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this age group.
If the blood pressure is not sufficiently controlled, the dose can be increased to 300 mg a day or other medicines for hypertension can be added, such as hydrochlorothiazide.
A starting dose of 75 mg can be used in patients receiving haemodialysis (a blood clearance technique) or in patients over 75 years of age.
By blocking the receptors to which angiotensin II normally attaches, irbesartan stops the hormone having an effect, allowing the blood vessels to widen.
