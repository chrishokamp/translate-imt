Dynepo is used to treat anaemia (fewer than normal red blood cells in the blood) in adult patients with chronic renal failure (long-term kidney disease).
The starting doses are 50 IU/kg three times a week if given intravenously, and twice a week if given subcutaneously.
The effectiveness of Dynepo to treat anaemia has been studied in a total of 1308 patients with chronic renal failure, including two main clinical studies.
The most common side effects are hypertension (raised blood pressure), headache, and, for patients on dialysis, problems with the dialysis tubes.
Dynepo should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin delta or any of the other ingredients, and in patients who have uncontrolled high blood pressure.
