Tarceva is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.
How does Tarceva work?
The active substance in Tarceva, erlotinib, is an anti-cancer medicine that belongs to the group "epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors."
Erlotinib blocks the epidermal growth factor receptors, which can be found on the surface of certain tumour cells.
As a result of this block, the tumour cell can no longer receive the messages needed for growth, progression and spreading (metastasis).
