This results in a "chasing gradient" situation between the two segments, without a mathematical intersection line between the two patches, except for the degenerate intersection at the corner point.
If the selected feature line has a constant level, a Lebvel option is available to set the level value for all vertices.
CentralReserveDepressed: Depressed central reserve between an attachment point and marked point with various parameters to control ditch geometry.
The null assembly serves as a placeholder object so that the junction object can still be created even though an assembly cannot be found.
