The left pane of the Traverse Editor displays the following properties for the selected setup within the current chainage point:
For example, set up a label style for a plot line to display the quadrant bearing and distance of that line, which are two of its basic components.
The final step is to calculate the A matrix, which relates the changes in coordinates to each observation determined through the use of distance observation equations and angle or whole circle bearing/quadrant bearing observation equations.
A compound curve is a curve consisting of two or more arcs of different radii curving in the same direction and having a common straight or transition curve at their point of junction.
Using this command, you can edit the levels of one feature line and then update the levels of another related feature line that exists alongside the first.
