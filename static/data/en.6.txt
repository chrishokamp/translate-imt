"Is this a revival of the bloody ideology?" was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.

Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish Community in Berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
