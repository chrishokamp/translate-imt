Over 19% of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident.
Moreover, the families of obese children do not practise sports. However, this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15% of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week.
The research was performed among 900 children.
The research took place at the end of last year's school year; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia.
