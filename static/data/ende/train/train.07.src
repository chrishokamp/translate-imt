Eurozone statistical offices in Germany, Czech Republic, and some other countries, released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has grown by the expected 0.5%; and France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data, where Germany did better than expected (a 0.3% increase instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (the original information suggested stagnation).
In this year's third quarter, the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5%.
Between the quarters though, the GDP stagnated. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth.
