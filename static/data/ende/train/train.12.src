Damjanovic and Vucinic became the match's least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities.
The wonderful Petr ÄŒech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year's European Championship. And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns.
From the opening minutes, the game was very pugnacious.
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination; the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time.
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half. Long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence.
