Why has Tarceva been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Tarceva had shown that it is effective in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, although there was not enough justification for, or data on its use in patients whose tumours are EGFR-negative.
For pancreatic cancer, the committee concluded that doctors and patients should take the patient's chances of survival into account when prescribing Tarceva.
