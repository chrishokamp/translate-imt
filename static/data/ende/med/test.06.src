What is the risk associated with Tarceva?
In clinical studies, the most common side effects when taking Tarceva (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were rash and diarrhoea.
Most of these were not serious and could be managed without treatment.
More serious rash and diarrhoea occurred in approximately 5-10% of Tarceva-treated patients and each side effect caused up to 1% of patients to stop treatment.
