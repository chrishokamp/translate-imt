How has Tarceva been studied?
The effects of Tarceva were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study in non-small cell lung cancer involved 731 patients who had not responded to at least one previous chemotherapy treatment.
The main study in pancreatic cancer involved 569 patients with advanced, unresectable (unable to be removed by surgery) or metastatic pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine.
In both studies, Tarceva was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) and the main measure of effectiveness was "median survivalâ€™ (time until 50% of the patients were still alive).
