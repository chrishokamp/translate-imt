Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't go out of my way," Favre said of all the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense battered Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble by Warner.
