Prague Stock Market falls to minus by the end of the trading day
After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses.
Transactions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise (ÄŒEZ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading.
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's trading, when it dropped by nearly six percent.
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop.
The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there, has manifested itself here as well.
